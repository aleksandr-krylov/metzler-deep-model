# Learning equivariant object representations from 2D images
*Equivariance with respect to symmetries of real scenes provides a strong
inductive bias for learning 3D scene representations.*

## Dataset

We have generated an original dataset of 3D shapes by following Shepard R.N. & Metzler J. psychophysics experimental setup.

The dataset includes 338 objects. Each object consists of ten solid cubes attached face-to-face to build up a rigid structure with exactly three right-angled structure and a possible loop in few cases.

The example of object rendering is illustrated at [this notebook](demo.ipynb)
